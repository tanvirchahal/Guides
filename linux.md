# Tools
* Terminator (For Terminal)

## Navigation Commands
* `pwd` for Print working directory
* `ls` for list contents of directory
* `ls -l` for long list of contents
* `~` (tilde) - This is a shortcut for your home directory. eg, if your home directory is `/home/ryan` then you could refer to the directory Documents with the path `/home/ryan/Documents` or `~/Documents`
*  `.` (dot) - This is a reference to your current directory. eg in the example above we referred to Documents on line 4 with a relative path. It could also be written as `./Documents` (Normally this extra bit is not required but in later sections we will see where it comes in handy).
* `..` (dotdot)- This is a reference to the parent directory. You can use this several times in a path to keep going up the hierarchy. eg if you were in the path /home/ryan you could run the command ls `../../` and this would do a listing of the root directory.
* `cd [location]` to move around folders
